# Android Github Workflow And Actions For CI CD ü§ñ

## Workflows
  A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.

## Workflow basics
A workflow must contain the following basic components:
  - One or more events that will trigger the workflow.
  - One or more jobs, each of which will execute on a runner machine and run a series of one or more steps.
  - Each step can either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.
